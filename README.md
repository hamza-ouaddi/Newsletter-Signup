# Newsletter-Signup
A Newsletter Signup Webpage

I made a new simple project after learning and practicing Node.js with its framework Express.js, it was a nice experience in the back-end side.
This is a "Signup webpage" for letternews that is common on many websites. The webpage is linked with Mailchimp API that can sync email activities, and manage audiences and campaigns.
